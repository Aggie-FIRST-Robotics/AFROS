This node allows you to run an lcd screen on the jetson. It's designed for the lcd screen 2004A that uses the standard
i2c interface found on many of these boards. (Chip PCF8574T ABX919)

It is configured to use bus 0 and address 0x27. In order to access this bus I recommend to run the command
"sudo chmod o+rw /dev/i2c-0"
